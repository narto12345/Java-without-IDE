#Template Java without IDE 

Hello everyone, these sources establish an initial template for creating Java projects from scratch without IDE.

#(.bat) files
The following files help compile, run and clean up the code.

- ("dev.bat"): this sceript compiles and runs the project, please do not change the initial class "com.bitsteam.app.App.java". This command will compile the code and save the bytecode files to the "target" folder.

- ("clean.bat"): This script allows you to completely clean the "target" folder if you wish.
